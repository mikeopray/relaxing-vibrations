# 🚨 Exit Code 234 Fix - URGENT

## Problem
Both H100 and CPU RunPod instances failing with:
```
worker exited with exit code 234
worker exited with exit code 234
worker exited with exit code 234
```

## Root Cause
The `verify_ffmpeg_installation()` function was:
1. **Called on every job** (not just startup)
2. **Trying to run apt-get commands** without proper permissions
3. **Causing unhandled exceptions** leading to exit code 234

## ✅ Fix Applied (v2.3.1)

### **1. Removed Job-Level FFmpeg Verification**
```python
# REMOVED - This was causing exit code 234:
if not verify_ffmpeg_installation():
    return {"error": "FFmpeg is not available and could not be installed"}
```

### **2. Made Startup Verification Safe**
```python
# NEW - Safe startup verification:
try:
    if verify_ffmpeg_installation():
        print("🚀 Worker ready - FFmpeg verified!")
    else:
        print("⚠️  FFmpeg verification failed - worker will start anyway")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️  FFmpeg verification error: {e}")
    print("ℹ️  Starting worker anyway - FFmpeg should be available")
```

### **3. Simplified FFmpeg Check**
- Removed apt-get installation attempts
- Made function exception-safe
- No longer crashes worker on failure

## 🚀 Deploy Fix Immediately

### **Build & Deploy**
```bash
# Build fixed image
docker build -t your-registry/ffmpeg-worker:v2.3.1 .

# Push to registry  
docker push your-registry/ffmpeg-worker:v2.3.1

# Update RunPod template to use v2.3.1
```

## ✅ Expected Results

### **Before Fix**
```
worker exited with exit code 234
worker exited with exit code 234
```

### **After Fix**
```
Starting RunPod FFmpeg merge worker v2.3.1 (Exit code 234 fix - stability improved)...
🔍 Verifying FFmpeg installation...
✅ FFmpeg is available and working
🚀 Worker ready - FFmpeg verified!
🚀 Starting RunPod serverless handler...
```

## 🧪 Test Immediately

Use this payload to test:
```json
{
  "input": {
    "video_url": "https://sample-videos.com/zip/10/mp4/480/sample_480x360_1mb.mp4",
    "audio_url": "https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/bell-ringing-05.mp3",
    "volume": 1.0
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Emergency Rollback (If Needed)

If issues persist, revert to previous working version:
```bash
# Use previous stable version
docker pull your-registry/ffmpeg-worker:v2.2
# Update RunPod template back to v2.2
```

## 📊 Status Check

### **Worker Logs Should Show:**
- ✅ Worker starts without exit code 234
- ✅ FFmpeg verification completes (or fails gracefully)  
- ✅ Handler starts and accepts jobs
- ✅ Jobs process successfully

### **No More:**
- ❌ Exit code 234 errors
- ❌ Worker restart loops
- ❌ FFmpeg apt-get permission errors

## 🎯 Priority Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Deploy v2.3.1 to both H100 and CPU instances
2. **TEST**: Send test payload to verify fix
3. **MONITOR**: Check worker logs for stability
4. **CONFIRM**: Verify jobs process successfully

## 📝 Technical Changes Summary

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| `worker.py` | Removed job-level FFmpeg verification | Eliminates exit code 234 |
